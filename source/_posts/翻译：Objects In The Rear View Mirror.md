# 翻译：Objects In The Rear View Mirror

于2021/07/18中午听到这首歌（其实是 How to with John Wilson 第三集的片尾曲），突然就喜欢上了。在网易云上没看到带翻译的版本，于是制作了翻译。

[网易云音乐：Objects In The Rear View Mirror](https://music.163.com/#/song?id=5162417)

翻译已提交，或许晚几天才能过审。

## 歌词翻译

```

[00:18.29]天空澄澈，旷野覆绿
[00:22.70]太阳比任何时候都更耀眼
[00:26.37]当我和我最好的朋友Kenny一同长大
[00:29.74]我们像你所知道的任何兄弟一样亲密
[00:35.52]那时的夏日永不结束，未来召唤着我们
[00:39.71]我们已准备好去冒险，我们想要所有的一切
[00:44.07]还有太多的东西可以去梦想
[00:47.79]还有太多时间可以去将其实现
[00:52.68]但我仍能忆起那一切带来的刺痛——
[00:56.83]他逝去时我那止不住的泪水
[01:00.89]他们说他坠毁了燃尽了但我永远也无法明白——
[01:04.81]为什么会有男孩那么早死去
[01:09.17]我们是赛车手，我们是命运的战士
[01:12.90]我们遇到麻烦但我们必定能走出来
[01:17.15]有时我觉得我看到他从黑暗中走了出来
[01:21.09]我觉得他就在我身边，他在赶上来
[01:29.27]但那已是很久以前，已是很远很远
[01:33.54]噢上帝那似乎真的好远了
[01:37.88]如果生活是高速公路
[01:41.75]灵魂大概就是一辆车
[01:48.65]后视镜中的物体（记忆中的往事）
[01:51.85]可能看起来比实际更近
[01:56.70]后视镜中的物体（记忆中的往事）
[01:59.90]可能看起来比实际更近
[02:04.90]后视镜中的物体（记忆中的往事）
[02:07.85]可能看起来比实际更近
[02:12.85]后视镜中的物体（记忆中的往事）
[02:15.97]可能看起来比实际更近
[02:51.96]当太阳落山，黑夜来临
[02:56.41]我听到我的父亲在咒骂他认识的每一个人
[03:00.24]他很危险，酩酊大醉，一败涂地
[03:03.34]被失败、妒忌和仇恨所腐蚀
[03:08.55]永不结束的冬天里，梦想被冰封
[03:13.06]无处可躲，没有叶片留在枝头
[03:16.92]父亲的眼睛空洞无神
[03:20.03]当他一次又一次地打我时
[03:24.79]我知道我仍然相信他永远不会让我离开，我不得不独自逃亡
[03:32.69]那么多的威胁和恐惧，那么多虚掷的岁月
[03:36.60]在我夺回我自己的生活之前
[03:40.59]尽管恶梦应该已经结束
[03:44.19]一些恐怖仍未消失
[03:48.14]我仍会听见那丑陋、粗俗而暴虐的声音
[03:51.96]他从后面抓住我
[03:54.72]把我拉回过去
[03:59.63]但那已是很久以前，已是很远很远
[04:03.84]噢上帝那似乎真的好远了
[04:08.07]如果生活是高速公路
[04:12.06]灵魂大概就是一辆车
[04:18.43]后视镜中的物体（记忆中的往事）
[04:21.55]可能看起来比实际更近
[04:26.35]后视镜中的物体（记忆中的往事）
[04:29.49]可能看起来比实际更近
[04:34.35]后视镜中的物体（记忆中的往事）
[04:37.27]可能看起来比实际更近
[04:42.17]后视镜中的物体（记忆中的往事）
[04:45.05]可能看起来比实际更近
[05:47.20]有个佳人住在城市的边缘
[05:51.72]她总是把车顶升起，把油门踩到底
[05:55.67]她教会了我一切我将知道的东西
[05:59.50]关于爱情的奥秘和力量
[06:04.06]群星闪烁，月光皎皎
[06:07.69]我像个罗密欧般和我的朱丽叶坐在后座上
[06:11.78]高速公路上的标志都说：
[06:16.06]注意! 孩子们在玩耍!
[06:19.52]那是春天的权利，我们什么都做了
[06:23.51]那时每天晚上我们都得到救赎
[06:27.40]我们撕碎内饰，我们让梦想重生
[06:31.22]但我们所做的一切都是正确的
[06:34.97]她使用她的身体如同一条绑带
[06:38.81]她使用我的身体如同一处伤口
[06:42.62]我可能永远不会知道她于何处消失
[06:46.31]但现在我可以看到她从后座上站起身来
[06:50.05]如同天使从坟墓中升起
[06:56.17]但那已是很久以前，已是很远很远
[07:00.43]噢上帝那似乎真的好远了
[07:04.83]如果生活是高速公路
[07:08.98]灵魂大概就是一辆车
[07:19.88]后视镜中的物体（记忆中的往事）
[07:22.82]可能看起来比实际更近

May appear closer than they are”

## 歌词原文

```
The skies were pure and the fields were green
And the sun was brighter than it's ever been
When I grew up with my best friend Kenny
We were close as any brothers than you ever knew
It was always summer and the future called
We were ready for adventures and we wanted them all
And there was so much left to dream
And so much time to make it real
But I can still recall the sting of all
The tears when he was gone
They said he crashed and burned I know I'll never learn
Why any boy should die so young
We were racing, we were soldiers of fortune
We got in trouble but we sure got around
There are times I think I see him peeling out of the dark
I think he's right behind me now and he's gaining ground
But it was long ago and it was far away,
Oh God it seems so very far
And if life is just a highway,
Then the soul is just a car
And objects in the rear view mirror
May appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror
May appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror
May appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror
May appear closer than they are
And when the sun descended and the night arose
I heard my father cursing everyone he knows
He was dangerous and drunk and defeated
And corroded by failure and envy and hate
There were endless winters and the dreams would freeze
Nowhere to hide and no leaves on the trees
And my father's eyes were blank
As he hit me again and again and again
I know I still believe he'd never let me leave, I had to run away alone
So many threats and fears, so many wasted years
Before my life became my own
And though the nightmares should be over
Some of the terrors are still intact
I'll hear that ugly coarse and violent voice
And then he grabs me from behind
And then he pulls me back
But it was long ago and it was far away,
Oh God it seems so very far
And if life is just a highway,
Then the soul is just a car
And objects in the rear view mirror
May appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror
May appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror
May appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror
May appear closer than they are
There was a beauty living on the edge of town
And she always put the top up and the hammer down
And she taught me everything I'll ever know
About the mystery and the muscle of love
The stars would glimmer and the moon would glow
I'm in the back seat with my Julie like a Romeo
And the signs along the highway all said,
Caution! Kids At Play!
Those were the rights of spring and we did everything
There was salvation every night
We got our dreams reborn and our upholstery torn
But everything we tried was right
She used her body just like a bandage,
She used my body just like a wound
I'll probably never know where she disappeared
But I can see her rising up out of the back seat now
Just like an angel rising up from a tomb
But it was long ago and it was far away,
Oh God it seems so very far
And if life is just a highway,
Then the soul is just a car
And objects in the rear view mirror
May appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror
May appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror
May appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror
May appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror
May appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror
May appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror
May appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror
May appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror
May appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror
May appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror
May appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror
May appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror
May appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror
May appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror
May appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror
May appear closer than they are
She used her body just like a bandage,
She used my body just like a wound
I'll never know where she disappeared
But I can see her rising up out of the back seat now
